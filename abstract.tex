Information is valuable.

Information can be encoded with language.

Digitised language can be preserved and shared infinitely.

Information Retrieval mediates our access to Digital Information.

The Language Barrier separates us from Information Retrieval Systems.

A symptom of the Language Barrier is Vocabulary Mismatch.

Vocabulary Mismatch causes Retrieval failure.

Retrieval failure makes me sad.

Vocabulary mismatch is caused by authors using different language to describe the same thing. In a Search Engine, mismatch can be addressed with Query Expansion: adding more words to a user's search query, such that it contains a more useful vocabulary. Unfortunately, expansion can cause \textit{query drift}, where the meaning changes from what user intended. The experiments herein attempt to mitigate query drift with language.
