# Makefile for use with a latex document that has a bibliography.
#
# To use: Create a directory to hold the source files and copy this file
# into it with the name "Makefile".
# Set the TITLE, CHAPTERS, and OSTYPE variables.
#
# typing "make" will make and view a .pdf file.
#
# Other Options:
#
# make clean: remove all auxiliary and temp files.
#
# make nuke: same as clean but remove main pdf file as well.
#
# make touch: force recompilation
#
# make backup: rsync the directory onto another machine
