I dedicate this thesis to my favourite person in the world, Caitlin Owen.

Big ups to the Australasian Document Computing Symposium (ADCS) for providing me with a travel grant allowing me to present my first ever published paper and gain first hand feedback which was invaluable in the final version of this thesis.

I would also like to thank my close friends, for without them you would not be reading this. Andrew Fletcher, Lu Conroy, Joshua La Pine, Vaughan Kitchen, Bryanna Jackson, Johnny Flame-Lee, Daniel Kitson, Katie Baddock, my sole supervisor Andrew Trotman, and all my nearest and dearest 939 Facebook friends. These people have taught me to be rigorous and exact in all that I say, unless doing otherwise would be more entertaining.
